= AppStream data for Debian Jessie =

The metadata and icons found in jessie-data/ are generated using experimental code
which may land in dak (the Debian Archive Kit) after the Jessie release.
You can find the code which generates this data at:
 https://github.com/abhi11/tanglu-dak
Or later in the dak repository at:
 https://ftp-master.debian.org/#dak
